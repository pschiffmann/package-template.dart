# pedantic (pschiffmann)

This is my own version of the [pedantic](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pedantic) package.
I use it to manage my Dart project settings - lint rules, analysis options, and IDE configuration.

All settings reflect personal preference and will be updated over time.
If you are contributing to one of my repos and don't agree with something you see, feel free to criticize.
